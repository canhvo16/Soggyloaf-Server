## **_Overview_**

SoggyLoaf is a full stack PERN application inspired by crunchyroll. Users are able to setup an account with SoggyLoaf to have access to a WatchList feature where they are able to save animes they choose to watch at a later time. Regardless of having an account or not, users can still browse through the application, search for anime, and have a list of episodes that link them to the streaming site.

## **_Future Update_**

#### After completing this project we would love to add more features to allow more user interaction.

- Have a slideshow with the user's watchlist on the homepage
- Have a method to play the actual video on our site vs navigating to Crunchyroll
- Add more info for the user and an avatar to represent the user
- Allow users to browse for anime by genre
